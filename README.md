Saying we want to add a cool feature - button "x" to run multiplication.
What code do we need to change/add/remove to support this feature?
Which tests can we run on the calculator? On the activity? On the app?
Answer:
-we need to add the button logic to the calculater implementation
-then we add the UI for it, for that we will add a textView button in the xml
-then add it to the MainActivity as a textview and add a listener like other buttons.
-we have 3 test files and we will add to each files tests that check the button x,the logic on the calculater and the flow.
